## Conclusion

The "My Semester Overview" webpage is a great way for students to manage their semester’s workload and track their academic progress. The project helped me enhance my skills in structuring content with HTML tables, styling them with CSS, and designing a user-friendly interface.

While the current page is simple, future improvements could include adding interactivity such as checkboxes for task completion or features for dynamically editing content. Additionally, optimizing the design for mobile devices by incorporating media queries could enhance the user experience.

This project has given me valuable insights into organizing information efficiently and has motivated me to explore more interactive features for further improving the tool.
