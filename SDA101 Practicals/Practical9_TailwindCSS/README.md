## Description

This project is a Responsive Webpage with Micro Interaction built using HTML and TailwindCSS. It provides a clean 
and modern layout with responsive elements, making it compatible with a variety of screen sizes. The web page 
features a welcoming message and a micro-interaction button that responds to user interaction, enhancing user 
engagement.

## Features

- Responsive Design: Adjusts layout for mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.

- Micro Interaction Button: The "HOVER ME!" button includes a hover effect that changes the background color and 
slightly scales the button. This is achieved using TailwindCSS’s hover:bg-green-900 and hover:scale-105 classes, 
creating a smooth transition and making the button more interactive.

- Minimalist Styling: The use of a minimalist color scheme (green and gray tones) and TailwindCSS’s predefined 
utility classes results in a clean, modern look. The layout is simple and easy to navigate, with a clear header, 
main content area, and footer.

## Technologies Used

- HTML for structuring the webpage.

- TailwindCSS for styling, responsiveness, and interactive effects.

## Conclusion

This project showcases how TailwindCSS can be used to create a responsive webpage with minimal code while 
maintaining a modern and clean design. The micro-interaction button demonstrates the power of TailwindCSS for adding 
dynamic elements without extra scripts, making it easy to add polish to a basic webpage. This project is an example 
of how utility-first CSS frameworks can streamline responsive and interactive design, setting a solid foundation for 
future web development.
