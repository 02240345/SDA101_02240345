## Description

The Custom Card Component project is a simple, reusable card component designed with web components and customizable 
CSS variables. This project leverages HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a structured card that can be styled or 
customized easily by modifying custom properties. It features three distinct sections: a header, main content, and a 
footer. Each section can be populated with any HTML content, making it versatile for various applications such as 
displaying user information, images, or content summaries.

## Features

- Custom Slots: The component utilizes slots (header, content, and footer) to allow for flexible content injection.

- CSS Custom Properties: Easily adjustable CSS variables allow customization of properties like background color, 
padding, and border-radius.

- JavaScript Component: A JavaScript file (card_component.js) defines the card as a reusable web component, 
providing modularity for integration into other projects.

- Responsive Layout: The card’s layout adjusts based on content size, making it adaptable for different devices or 
screen sizes.


## Technologies Used

- HTML: For the structure of the custom card and slot definition.

- CSS: Uses custom properties and styling to control the card’s appearance.

- JavaScript: A JavaScript file (card_component.js) defines the behavior of the custom component, enhancing 
modularity and reuse.

## Conclusion

The Custom Card Component project showcases the power of web components and CSS custom properties, providing a 
modular, customizable UI element. The use of JavaScript to define this reusable component offers flexibility, while 
slots allow easy integration of different types of content. This approach enhances efficiency in UI development and 
promotes code reusability across projects.
