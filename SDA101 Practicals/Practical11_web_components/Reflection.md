# Custom Card Component

## Overview

The Custom Card Component project demonstrates how to create a reusable web component using HTML, CSS, and 
JavaScript. The <custom-card> component includes customizable sections for a header, content, and footer, utilizing 
CSS variables to adjust styling. This design provides flexibility, allowing for various layouts within a single, 
reusable structure.

## Challenges Faced

- Creating Custom Elements: One challenge was learning how to define and register custom elements, especially to 
ensure that the slots (header, content, footer) were functioning correctly within the component structure.

- CSS Custom Properties: Managing and effectively using CSS custom properties for dynamic styling required practice, 
as each variable had to be correctly named and applied for consistency in the componentâ€™s appearance.

- JavaScript File Link and Loading: Since the component functionality relies on the card_component.js script, 
ensuring the file was correctly linked and loaded without delays required careful handling, including testing with 
the defer attribute.

## What I Learned

- This project enhanced my understanding of creating and using custom elements, particularly the <slot> element, 
which allows users to insert HTML content within specific sections of the component.

- I learned to use CSS variables effectively, providing a way to change styles globally or locally within components 
without modifying the core CSS each time.

- Linking JavaScript with web components taught me how JavaScript can be utilized for custom elements, preparing me 
for more complex, interactive components.

## Conclusion

Working on the Custom Card Component project provided a practical introduction to web components and CSS custom 
properties, emphasizing the power of reusability and modularity in modern web design. I am now more confident in 
using web components for building flexible, customizable UI elements and look forward to implementing them in more 
dynamic projects.
