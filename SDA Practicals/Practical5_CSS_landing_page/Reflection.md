# Tech Gadget Store Landing Page

## Overview

The project is a simple landing page for an online store, TechGadgets, that offers a range of technology products. 
This webpage showcases a header, navigation links, a hero section, a featured product grid, and a footer with social 
media links and policies.

## Challenges Faced

- Image Sourcing and Layout: Finding the right images and sizing them properly for consistency was challenging. 
Images needed to be high quality but also optimized for quick loading times, which involved balancing visual quality 
with file size.

- Accessibility Features: Understanding and applying accessibility practices, such as using appropriate aria-label 
attributes and descriptive alt texts for images, required additional research and consideration.

- Styling Consistency: Ensuring consistent styling across all elements was another challenge. With multiple 
sections, maintaining uniform fonts, colors, and spacing required extra attention and debugging.

## What I Learned

- I gained a deeper understanding of how semantic HTML and accessibility features improve user experience, 
especially for users who rely on screen readers.

- Writing CSS thatâ€™s well-organized and scalable helped me understand the importance of reusable styles and 
modularity, which is essential for building more extensive projects.

- I learned to balance aesthetic elements with site performance, ensuring images and resources were optimized to 
prevent slow load times, especially on mobile devices.

## Conclusion

This project was an insightful experience that strengthened my foundational skills in HTML, CSS, and accessibility. 
By building a fully functional landing page with a clean and organized structure, I developed a better understanding 
of responsive design principles, web accessibility, and the importance of a consistent user experience. Moving 
forward, I plan to deepen my skills in responsive design and explore advanced accessibility features to create even 
more user-friendly web pages.
