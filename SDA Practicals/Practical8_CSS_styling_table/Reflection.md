# Grade Tracker

## Overview

The Grade Tracker web page is designed to display a table of assignments, with relevant data such as module names, 
maximum marks, marks obtained, percentages, and grades. This layout allows us to view our performance at a 
glance and easily track our academic progress across different assignments. The table includes headers for each 
column and rows with individual assignment details, with color-coded grade cells to make the grades visually 
distinguishable.

## Challenges Faced

- Structuring Table Rows and Columns: One of the initial challenges was ensuring that each piece of information 
appeared in the correct column and that headers aligned with the data. 

- Applying CSS to Specific Grades: Assigning CSS classes to specific grades (e.g., grade-B or grade-A) was 
challenging, as each grade needed a separate style. 

- Balancing Simplicity with Readability: Keeping the design simple while ensuring that data was easy to read was a 
balancing act. Since the table contains numeric data, I needed to use enough spacing and clear fonts to avoid 
clutter and improve readability.

## What I Learned

- Learned effective data organization using <tr> and <td> tags.

- Practiced using CSS classes to color-code grades, making data visually distinguishable.

- Realized the importance of clear fonts, spacing, and minimal color for effective data presentation.

## Conclusion

This project improved my skills in HTML tables and CSS styling, highlighting how small design choices enhance 
readability. I also gained insight into making data presentation dynamic, which I plan to explore further in future 
projects.
