## Description

This project is a simple HTML page displaying a list of upcoming college events, each with specific event details 
such as time and location. The page uses an ordered list (<ol>) for listing events, and each event includes an 
unordered list (<ul>) with nested details for readability. This structure helps present the event information in an 
organized, easy-to-read format.

## Features

- Organized Event Listings: The page uses an ordered list (<ol>) for arranging the events in a sequential manner. 
Each event is then broken down further with a nested unordered list (<ul>), containing information such as the event 
time and location. This structure keeps the event details organized and intuitive to navigate.

- Expandable for Additional Features: The page structure can easily accommodate more events, details, or interactive 
elements. For instance, JavaScript could be added to enable filtering by event type, search functionality, or 
registration links for individual events.

- Easy Navigation with Clear Hierarchy: The hierarchical list structure provides a clear visual flow, making it easy 
for users to scan through events and quickly locate important information, such as locations and start times.


## Technologies Used

- HTML: The project uses HTML for the core structure of the webpage. 

- CSS (Styling_list.css): The CSS file can be used to add aesthetic elements, such as color schemes, font styles, 
padding, and margin adjustments to make the page more visually engaging and easier to navigate.

## Conclusion

The College Events web page serves as a foundational template for listing college events in an organized, 
accessible, and user-friendly way. By combining a clear HTML structure with potential CSS styling, the page 
successfully displays essential event details in a digestible format.
