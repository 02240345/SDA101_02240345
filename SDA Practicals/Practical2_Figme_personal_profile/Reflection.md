# Personal Profile Design Figma

For this design, I created a personal profile page in Figma with a focus on simplicity and a professional tone. My 
goal was to showcase a minimalist portfolio layout that highlights essential information, such as my name, bio, 
skills, and links to social profiles, without overwhelming the viewer. 

## Key Elements:

- Navigation Bar: At the top, I added a navigation bar with links to “BIO,” “PORTFOLIO,” “PROFILE,” and “BLOG.” This 
layout makes it easy for users to navigate between different sections. The simple typography in all-caps gives a 
clean, organized feel that suits a personal portfolio.

- Introduction Section: I structured my name in a stacked format on the left side, which makes it visually distinct. 
The bold typography gives it prominence, and the first line, "I'm," introduces the design in a friendly and 
approachable manner. Below the name, I added a short bio that provides context about my educational background and 
interests.

- Skills Section: This section displays the tools I’m skilled in, like Figma and VS Code. Including icons next to 
each skill enhances visual appeal and quickly communicates my technical abilities without needing a lot of text.

- Social Media Links: At the bottom of the page, I included social media icons for Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest, 
along with my handle. This addition makes it easy for visitors to connect with me on other platforms, enhancing the 
page’s functionality.

## Challenges:

One of the main challenges in this design was balancing the text and image sections. It was important to keep the 
page visually balanced and uncluttered while ensuring that essential information was prominently displayed. Finding 
the right font and font size to make the design look professional yet friendly took some experimentation.

## Reflection:

This project has been a good opportunity for me to understand personal branding more distinctly in relation to 
design. For instance, I came to discover that basic layouts can be very effective when combined with appropriate 
type and space. Also, I was able to learn about the concept of visual hierarchy and how it is applied while 
designing the content for this profile page. Looking ahead, I’d like to incorporate more color schemes and 
interactive elements to enhance the dynamism of the design even more.
