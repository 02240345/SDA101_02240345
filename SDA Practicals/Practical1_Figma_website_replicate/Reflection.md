# Website Replication

For this design, I used Figma to replicate the classic Google homepage, focusing on capturing the clean, minimalist 
aesthetic that defines Google's user experience. This exercise aimed to recreate the familiar search interface, 
keeping the color scheme, layout, and interactive elements aligned with Google's branding and usability standards.

## Key Elements:

- Logo and Colors: The Google logo, with its characteristic blue, red, yellow, and green colors, was recreated to 
match the iconic look of the homepage.

- Search Bar: The search bar was placed at the center of the design with rounded edges, reflecting Google's design. 
This central positioning ensures the user's primary interaction point is prominent and easily accessible.

- Buttons ("Google Search" and "I'm Feeling Lucky"): I replicated the two main buttons below the search bar, styled 
in a subtle gray to maintain a minimalist look. These buttons are integral to the original design, providing quick 
access to Google's core functionalities.

- Language Options: I included the language selection text, “Google offered in: Indonesia Basa Bali,” to mimic how 
Google adapts to different regions and languages. This detail adds a layer of authenticity to the replication by 
acknowledging localization.

- Footer Links: I added the links at the bottom of the page ("Business," "About," "How Search Works," etc.) in a 
small, muted font. These links are essential in creating a sense of completeness, as they’re always available on 
Google's homepage.

- Top Links (Gmail, Images, Grid Icon): The design also includes links to "Gmail" and "Images," along with the grid 
icon representing Google's app launcher. I positioned these in the top-right corner, consistent with Google’s layout 
for quick navigation.

## Challenges:

One of the main challenges was making sure all the interspacing and orientation appeared in the finished piece as it 
had in the original design. Elements of Google’s design are presented in a very minimalist way which brings out 
every detail so alignment here had to be perfect. Further to that, it was important to pick the appropriate type and 
point size to replicate the undemanding but iconic typography of Google.

## Reflection:

The activity highlighted again how UI/UX design requires a great deal of attention to details. While out of the box 
interfaces such as the one designed for Google may seem easy to create, a lot of consideration must be put into 
spacing and proper color application for an individual to achieve the desired effect. In the course of working on 
this project, I learned to value the subtleties of minimalist design and how important it is to incorporate certain 
principles in order to establish a brand.
