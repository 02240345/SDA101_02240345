# Weekly Course Schedule

## Overview

The Weekly Course Schedule project is a basic representation of a typical weekly timetable used by students to track their courses and lecture timings. The schedule includes fixed time slots and the courses scheduled for each day, along with a dedicated lunch period. It is built using HTML and CSS, which allows for simple presentation without complex interactivity.

## Challenges Faced

- Layout Design: While designing the table, it was a challenge to create a balanced structure that looks organized 
and is easy to understand at a glance. Achieving consistency in the design, with clear borders and readable text, 
required multiple iterations.

- Responsive Design: Ensuring the table structure adjusts well across devices was a challenge. Although the table is 
simple, future improvements can be made to make it more mobile-friendly by incorporating media queries and adjusting 
column widths for smaller screens.

- Time Slot Presentation: Presenting time slots in a table format was straightforward, but I initially faced 
difficulty managing the course durations and ensuring they fit cleanly into each time block. Since the course 
durations overlap for some courses, adjusting the layout was an important step.

## What I Learned

- Table Structuring in HTML: I learned how to efficiently structure a table with rows and columns to display the 
class schedule in an organized way. This taught me how to manage multi-row and multi-column tables for better data 
presentation.

- CSS Styling for Tables: I applied various CSS properties such as border-collapse, padding, text-align, and 
background-color to create a clean and readable layout for the table. This helped me understand the importance of 
styling for user experience.

- Layout Adaptation: I learned the importance of considering different screen sizes and the need for responsive 
design. While the current layout works well on desktop, I realize the need for further enhancements for mobile 
compatibility.

## Conclusion

The Weekly Course Schedule project was a great opportunity to practice organizing information in a clear and 
user-friendly format. Although it is a basic implementation, I learned key web development concepts such as HTML 
table structure and CSS styling. Moving forward, I plan to focus on enhancing mobile responsiveness and adding 
interactivity to make the schedule more adaptable and engaging for users.
