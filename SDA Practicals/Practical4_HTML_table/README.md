## Description

The Weekly Course Schedule is a simple web-based table that provides a clear and organized view of a student's 
weekly class schedule. This schedule includes time slots, course names, and the days of the week. It serves as a 
helpful reference to quickly check which courses are scheduled at specific times, making it easier to manage and 
plan daily activities.

## Features

- Time Slot and Day Overview: Displays the time slots for each day of the week, from Monday to Saturday.
- Courses Listed by Day: Each dayâ€™s column lists the courses scheduled during specific time slots.
- Lunch Break: A dedicated lunch slot from 11:00 AM to 1:00 PM, available for all days.
- Seminars: Special seminar slots are included on Friday and Saturday, for designated courses.
- Responsive Layout: The table layout is designed to automatically adjust for all screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- HTML: Used for structuring the webpage and table.

- CSS: Applied for styling the table to improve readability, including borders, padding, and background colors for 
headers.

- Responsive Design: The table structure is adaptable for different screen sizes, though it could be further 
improved with advanced media queries for mobile optimization.

## Conclusion

The Weekly Course Schedule is a basic yet effective tool for organizing and presenting class schedules in an 
easy-to-read format. The project can be expanded to include more advanced features, such as dynamically updating 
course slots or integrating with a database to personalize the schedule for individual users. In future iterations, 
I plan to improve the layout for mobile devices and add interactive elements to enhance user experience.
